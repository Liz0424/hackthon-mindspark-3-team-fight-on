Motivation: 
Drowsiness is one of the common reasons for road accidents (only behind DUI), especially among truck or bus drivers who drive for long hours.
Self-driving/autonomous vehicles make this scenario worse as they reduce the active involvement of drivers in driving.

Problem statement: 
Drowsiness detection.

Solution:
We are trying to solve this problem actively by:
1. Detecting the drowsiness of the driver beforehand, that is, by detecting yawning, which is one of the common symptoms of tiredness
2. Detecting the eye fixation (close/open) and position which is the common sign of sleepiness.

By detecting the driver's drowsiness accurately and actively, we can force him to either stop driving (autonomous car can switch off) or 
warn him about his situation or force him to reduce the speed of his vehicle.
We can also use this information to decide/rate the driving eligibility.
